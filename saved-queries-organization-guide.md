4. **Visual Scanning**: Use color-coded badges to quickly identify query types

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **For Students:**

#### **Consistent Naming:**
- Use consistent class codes (e.g., always "CS101" not "cs101" or "Computer Science 101")
- Use consistent topic names (e.g., always "Machine Learning" not "ML" or "AI")

#### **Organization Strategy:**
- **Topic**: Use for broad themes (e.g., "Climate Change", "World War II")
- **Class Code**: Use official course codes (e.g., "HIST201", "BIO101")
- **Subject**: Use academic disciplines (e.g., "History", "Biology")
- **Project**: Use for specific assignments (e.g., "Final Paper", "Assignment 3")

#### **Tagging Strategy:**
- Use tags for cross-cutting concepts (e.g., "research", "homework", "presentation")
- Keep tags short and consistent
- Use 3-5 tags per query for best organization

### **For Instructors:**
- Encourage students to use consistent class codes
- Suggest standard topics for your course
- Use projects to organize by assignment types

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- New fields added to SavedQuery model
topic       String?  // e.g., "Machine Learning", "History"
class       String?  // e.g., "CS101", "HIST201"
subject     String?  // e.g., "Computer Science", "History"
project     String?  // e.g., "Final Paper", "Assignment 3"
```

### **API Updates:**
- **POST /api/saved-queries**: Now accepts organization fields
- **PUT /api/saved-queries/[id]**: Can update organization fields
- **GET /api/saved-queries**: Returns organization data

### **UI Components:**
